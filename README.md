# ToDoCard
A To-Do card set that will synchronise with Google Calendar eventually.

## Summary
 This To-Do card set is built for Sherry's personal productivity benefit so that she could efficiently update the study schedules during revision.

## Problem
 Currently Trello is not able to synchronise with Google Calendar on a hour scale and the Trello cards do not correspond to individual Calendar event. Sherry enjoys creating todo list on Trello as it requires less clicks but she found it hard having to manually specify time for each task. 

## Solution 
 This To-Do card set will sync with Google calendar so that changing the order in the card set will be reflected on the Google calendar. Adustment in the time frame of events on Google calendar will also be reflected on the To-Do list
